# Hey-Day-Script
Hey Day will be on October 16, 2024

Hey Day is an Auburn University tradition where students and faculty can make name tags to wear around campus encouraging others to say "Hey". It was started as a way to make students returning from sereving in WWII feel welcomed back to Auburn and has been a tradition ever since. For more information on Hey Day in general and the 2024 event, see the SGA page: https://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/ 

Following the Auburn tradition, this program is designed to allow the user to enter their name and then reads the name and gives them a nice greeting.
